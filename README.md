## Why make this?
I'm burnt out from working on Natsumi, I guess. So I thought it'd be a good idea to make the complete
opposite of Natsumi: a skin that **makes the browser WORSE.**

## Configs
- `unusable.theme.enabled`: Enables the mod.
- `unusable.theme.base`: Will probably cause migraines like I did
- `unusable.theme.hotdog`: bacon wrapped hot dog stand
